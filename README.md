# fullStack-miniProjects

A collection of **mini CRUD projects** to practice building **frontend** and **full-stack** applications with different approaches — from using simple `localStorage` to a relational database with `SQLite`.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is meant as a learning playground to:

- Understand the fundamentals of **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Experiment with different ways to persist data
- Get hands-on practice with **Next.js** and **TypeScript** in real-world scenarios
- Build a solid foundation for more advanced applications

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) — React full-stack framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) — static typing for safer code
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) — lightweight relational database
- **localStorage** — simple client-side persistence
- [React Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react) — state management and reusable logic
- [CSS / Tailwind] — component styling (used in some projects)

---

Each folder contains a small project or example focusing on a different CRUD approach.
